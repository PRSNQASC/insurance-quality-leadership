# Access to Detailed Quality Artefacts

Due to the regulated and commercially sensitive nature of insurance
delivery, detailed quality artefacts are maintained in a private
repository.

These include:
- Test strategies and governance models
- Executive risk dashboards
- Quality maturity assessments
- Case studies and examples

Access can be granted on request for:
- Hiring managers
- Programme and delivery leaders
- Recruiters representing active roles

Please request access via GitHub or via the recruitment agency.
