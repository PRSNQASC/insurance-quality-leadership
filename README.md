# Insurance Quality & Test Leadership

This repository provides a high-level overview of my approach to
quality leadership, test strategy, and risk-based assurance within
Commercial and Lloyd’s Market insurance environments.

It is intentionally concise and high-level due to the regulated and
commercially sensitive nature of insurance delivery.
